# Dave's Mapper

This is the code behind [Dave's Mapper](https://davesmapper.com). It's based on the Morph Mapper by Rob Lang, but vastly larger in scope and ambition.

## Development

This section of documentation is currently a work in progress.

### Building Assets

The following pre-requisites must be installed:
- [Inkscape][inkscape]
- [Node.js][nodejs]
- [Yarn][yarn]

Run `./build.sh` to build assets.
