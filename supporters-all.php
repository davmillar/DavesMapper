        <section class="columns">
          <p>Many of the contributors to Dave's Mapper have other role-playing projects that can be of great use to game masters.</p>
          <h3><a href="https://www.patreon.com/dysonlogos">Dyson Logos on Patreon</a></h3>
            <p>The originator of the geomorph map movement, Dyson Logos, is using Patreon to keep his art flowing. Sponsoring him means a steady supply of new, high-quality maps will be available to GMs and DMs for years to come. If you've enjoyed his tiles here, please <a href="https://www.patreon.com/dysonlogos">pledge to Dyson Logos on Patreon</a> &#8212; you won't regret it.</p>
          <h3><a href="http://www.dungeonmorphs.com/">DungeonMorph Dice</a></h3>
            <p>The awesome concept and planning by Joe Wetzel of Inkwell Ideas turned into the <a href="http://www.dungeonmorphs.com/">DungeonMorph Dice</a> project. I'm glad to have been a part of it, and happy that the mapper played a small role in bringing together some of the contributors to his project. Check out the dice, cards, font, and other cool stuff Joe is making with map tiles over at <a href="http://www.dungeonmorphs.com/">DungeonMorphs.com</a>.</p>

            <p>The app's original functionality is based on the original Morph Mapper and Monkey Mapper written by <a href="http://www.thefreerpgblog.com/" target="_blank">Rob Lang</a>. Without Rob's work, none of this would have been possible.</p>

            <p>Jarrah from Rock Propelled Game inspired the 3D cube layout option I added with <a href="http://rocketpropelledgame.blogspot.com/2010/03/cubic-dungeon.html">this blog post of a cubic dungeon</a>.

      <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Dave's Mapper started out as an improvement on the mappers made by <a href="http://www.thefreerpgblog.com/" target="_blank">Rob Lang</a>. When I noticed that wide maps broke across lines rather than being the proper size, I wrote a line or two of code that could fix it, as well as a few lines to randomly rotate tiles for an extra feature.</p>
        <p>Shortly thereafter, I came up with my own set of tiles and thought it would be fun to make my own mapper for my tiles; one that would fix some of the issues and add the features not present in Rob's mappers. I soon asked a few other tile artists if they would be interested in having their tiles featured, and off I went building this mapper you see here. The support from the community has been awesome and I can't thank everyone enough!</p>
      <h2>Donors</h2>
        <p>In early 2011, Dave's Mapper had a funding drive to get $200 for the costs of putting the mapper on a new domain and hosting plan. Thank you to all of the donors who helped reach the $200 goal and helped keep Dave's Mapper up and running for the next 3 years!</p>
        <p>If you would like to help support the mapper, please consider donations toward Dave's personal medical bills or a donation to the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America. Links for those are in the footer.</p>
